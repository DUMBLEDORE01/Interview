## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend-engineer
   ```

2. **Choose a problem** from the list above

3. **Set up your development environment**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Start development server
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Read the problem statement** in the `problems/` directory

5. **Implement your solution** following the requirements

6. **Run tests** to validate your implementation
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

7. **Submit your solution** by creating a pull request

```

## Evaluation Process

Your solution will be evaluated using:

1. **Functionality Testing** - Feature completeness and user flows
2. **Code Quality Analysis** - Linting, formatting, and complexity metrics
3. **LLM Code Review** - AI-powered analysis of your implementation
4. **Performance Testing** - Lighthouse scores and performance metrics
5. **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG compliance and usability
6. **Responsive Design** - Mobile and tablet compatibility

## Scoring Breakdown

- **Functionality** (30%) - Does the solution work correctly?
- **Code Quality** (25%) - Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- **UI/UX** (20%) - User experience and interface design
- **Performance** (15%) - Speed, optimization, and efficiency
- **Testing** (10%) - Test coverage and quality

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow ESLint and Prettier rules
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow React best practices

2. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Include integration tests for user flows
   - Achieve at least 80% test coverage
   - Test accessibility features

3. **Documentation**
