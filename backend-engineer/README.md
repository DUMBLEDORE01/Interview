# Backend Engineer Assessment

Technical assessment for Backend Engineer candidates focusing on API development, database design, system architecture, and backend best practices.

## Overview

This assessment evaluates candidates on:
- **API Design & Development** - RESTful APIs, GraphQL, microservices
- **Database Design** - Data modeling, SQL optimization, NoSQL solutions
- **System Architecture** - Scalability, performance, security
- **Code Quality** - Clean code, testing, documentation
- **DevOps Integration** - CI/CD, containerization, monitoring

## Assessment Structure

### Problem 1: RESTful API Development
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Tech Stack**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker

Build a RESTful API for a task management system with:
- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for tasks and projects
- Database relationships and constraints
- Input validation and error handling
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- API design patterns and REST conventions
- Database schema design and relationships
- Authentication and security implementation
- Error handling and validation
- Code organization and structure
- Testing coverage and quality

### Problem 2: Microservice Architecture
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Tech Stack**: FastAPI, Redis, Message Queue, Docker Compose

Design and implement a microservice architecture for an e-commerce system:
- User service (authentication, profiles)
- Product service (catalog, inventory)
- Order service (order management, payments)
- Service communication and data consistency
- API gateway and load balancing

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Service decomposition and boundaries
- Inter-service communication patterns
- Data consistency strategies
- Error handling and resilience
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Monitoring and observability

### Problem 3: Performance Optimization
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Tech Stack**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Performance Testing

Optimize a slow-performing API endpoint:
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
- Connection pooling
- Async processing
- Performance benchmarking

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Performance analysis and profiling
- Database optimization techniques
- Caching implementation
- Async/await patterns
- Performance testing methodology
- Optimization results and metrics

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend-engineer
   ```

2. **Choose a problem** from the list above

3. **Set up your development environment**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Set up Docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Read the problem statement** in the `problems/` directory

5. **Implement your solution** following the requirements

6. **Run tests** to validate your implementation
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

7. **Submit your solution** by creating a pull request

```

## Evaluation Process

Your solution will be evaluated using:

1. **Automated Testing** - Test execution and coverage analysis
2. **Code Quality Analysis** - Linting, formatting, and complexity metrics
3. **LLM Code Review** - AI-powered analysis of your implementation
4. **Performance Testing** - Response time, throughput, and resource usage
5. **Security Analysis** - Vulnerability assessment and best practices
6. **Architecture Review** - Design patterns and scalability considerations

## Scoring Breakdown

- **Functionality** (30%) - Does the solution work correctly?
- **Code Quality** (25%) - Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- **Architecture** (20%) - Good design patterns and structure
- **Testing** (15%) - Test coverage and quality
- **Performance** (10%) - Efficiency and optimization

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Include comprehensive docstrings
   - Use type hints where appropriate
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all functions
   - Include integration tests for APIs
   - Achieve at least 80% test coverage
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

3. **Documentation**
   - Clear README with setup instructions
   - API documentation with examples
   - Architecture diagrams if applicable
   - Deployment and configuration notes

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement appropriate caching
   - Use async patterns where beneficial
   - Include performance benchmarks

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple** - Begin with a basic working solution
- **Iterate** - Refactor and improve based on testing
- **Test Early** - Write tests as you develop features
- **Document** - Keep documentation up to date
- **Optimize** - Profile and optimize performance bottlenecks
