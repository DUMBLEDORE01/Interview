## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd devops-engineer
   ```

2. **Choose a problem** from the list above

3. **Set up your development environment**
   ```bash
   # Install required tools
   ./scripts/setup_environment.sh
   
   # Configure cloud credentials
   ./scripts/configure_cloud.sh
   ```

4. **Read the problem statement** in the `problems/` directory

5. **Implement your solution** following the requirements

6. **Validate your implementation**
   ```bash
   # Run validation scripts
   ./scripts/validate_solution.sh
   ```

7. **Submit your solution** by creating a pull request

## Evaluation Process

Your solution will be evaluated using:

1. **Infrastructure Validation** - Does the infrastructure deploy correctly?
2. **Security Analysis** - Security best practices and compliance
3. **LLM Code Review** - AI-powered analysis of your implementation
4. **Performance Testing** - Resource usage and scalability
5. **Documentation Quality** - Clear documentation and runbooks
6. **Best Practices** - Industry-standard DevOps methodologies

## Scoring Breakdown

- **Functionality** (30%) - Does the solution work correctly?
